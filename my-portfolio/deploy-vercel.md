# Quick Fix for MIME Type Error

## The Problem
The error `Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html"` occurs because:

1. **Wrong base path**: Your `vite.config.ts` had `base: '/Portfolio_website/'` configured for GitHub Pages
2. **Incorrect routing**: Vercel needs proper SPA routing configuration

## The Solution

### 1. Commit the Fixes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment: remove GitHub Pages base path and update routing"
git push
```

### 2. Redeploy on Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Click "Redeploy" or wait for automatic deployment

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Vercel:
- `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY`
- `VITE_APIFY_API_TOKEN`
- `VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
- `VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Removed GitHub Pages base path** from `vite.config.ts`
✅ **Removed homepage field** from `package.json`
✅ **Updated Vercel routing** to use proper SPA fallback
✅ **Fixed module loading** for Vite build

## Test Your Deployment

After redeployment, your site should:
- ✅ Load without MIME type errors
- ✅ Have working navigation
- ✅ Display all components correctly
- ✅ Have functional API calls (if environment variables are set)

---

**If you still see errors after redeployment, check the Vercel build logs for any additional issues.**
